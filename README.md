# Nae-Nae-Case
**_What is this_**

This project is a _customizable_ small form factor cardboard PC case

**_Why'd you make this_**

I wanted to make my own cardboard case but couldn't really find any info on how to design or build one

I made this to make it easier for others to do the same thing, hopefully you can find some useful info here

**_Specs and supported hardware_**

- 200x200x300mm 12.0L
- ITX motherboard
- up to 153mm CPU cooler
- up to 2.5 slot GPU 195mm length, 135mm height
- up to fullsize atx PSU 140x150x86mm; could probably fit up to 150mm long, maybe 160mm without SSD
- 2x 3.5" HDD
- 2x 2.5" SSD

How to edit this project to suit your own needs

- [ ] Visualize your airflow pattern
- [ ] Visualize your case/component layout
- [ ] Find and record your component dimensions, this can often be found on the manufacturers product page under specs
- [ ] Download this repository
- [ ] Download and install FreeCAD
- [ ] Learn FreeCad (you only need the basics, I didn't even use 3D; I recommend these 5 videos to learn enough to do what I did: Sketcher [1](https://youtu.be/u8otDF_C_fw), [2](https://youtu.be/-9KATZg1PqM), [3](https://youtu.be/sXPapS0WLgk); TechDraw [a](https://youtu.be/Ck0vY5Z6KBs), [b](https://youtu.be/3hbQH3Vq4Bo)) You could also open the FreeCAD file in the repository and mess around from there
- [ ] Read over instructions.txt for useful info on how to actually construct your case, even if the layout of yours is drastically different.
- [ ] Edit the dimensions and shape of the panels to suit your needs; for example you may only need room for an SFX power supply, and want support for a 3 slot 300mm GPU, and have no HDDs or SSDs (I recommend at least 10mm clearence past any port for cables, ideally 20mm)
- [ ] (optional) Export your dimensioned drawings for use in constructing the case. You could reference them from FreeCAD, but if you print them 1:1 they may be useful as a stencil. 

If you have any questions please dm me so I can make the project more helpful
