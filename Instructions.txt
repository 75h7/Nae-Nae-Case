Tools and materials
- cardboard (I flattened a big amazon box about 3mm thick, this also helps with seams)
- hot glue gun/sticks (I only needed 2 mini gluesticks)
- box cutter and cutting surface (scrap cardboard underneath works if you're careful)
- straightedge
- screwdriver
- (optional) a pen for marking the cardboard


Required reading

Please check out this great tutorial on working with cardboard
https://www.instructables.com/Pro-Tips-for-Using-Cardboard/
The main thing we'll use in this project is "Double-Layering, Crosshatched Style" structural reinforcement for the motherboard tray and the front of the case

This isn't necessarily required, but it covers every aspect of hot glue including the basics
It's not a bad idea to at least check out the "Tips & safety advice" section

Please read over all the steps before you start, so you know what to expect


Steps

1. Download and open the drawings in the "Drawings" folder
- chrome can open .svg

2. (optional) Print out the dimensioned drawings in "Drawings" to scale, you can use them as a stencil to make cutting easier

3. Mark and cut out the motherboard tray as 2 plain rectangles (the cable cutouts are easier to do once both pieces are together)
- make sure you cut out one panel with perpindicular "grain" direction

4. Glue together the motherboard panels
- work quickly as the glue dries fast

5. Mark and cut out the cable cutouts
- these are assuming your SATA power connector ends on the left hard drive, otherwise it will push up against the motherboard tray

6. Mark and cut out the front/top and front/bottom panels
- again make sure the grain is perpindicular before you cut the second panel
- I recommend using an existing fold on the box you cut from
- don't cut out the fan hole yet, you'll do this after they're together

7. Glue the front/top and front/bottom panels together
- the center should be twice as thick as the rest
- both folds should face the same direction, these are the top and bottom panels

8. Mark and cut out the fan hole
- cutting circles in cardboard is difficult and dangerous, try to cut in small straight lines

9. Glue the inside edges of the fan hole
- maybe not necessary, but I think not doing this could mess with the airflow pattern

10. Mark and cut out the back panel
- only cut the sides and top of the hole on the right, this will be folded down to screw in the GPU

11. Mark and cut out the remaining panels

12. Glue the inside edges of the fan holes

13. Place your PSU on the right side of the bottom panel with the fan facing out.
- the right side is with the front panel facing you
- alternative method: with the front panel facing you, measure and mark 87mm from the right multiple times

14. Place the mobo/PSU divider panel against the PSU/marks and glue it in place from the mobo side
- make sure the cable cutouts are on the cable side of the PSU (front of the case)
- don't glue the top panel, this is how you will access the inside

15. After the glue has dried, glue it from the other side as well
- make sure the PSU will still fit and not hang over the right edge

16. Lay the case down on its front and place the 120mm intake fan so that the hole lines up with the hole on the front

17. Mark the screw holes

18. Punch the screw holes
- the screwdriver works great for this

19. Screw in the fan
- This is the hardest part of the build, push peg mounting didn't work for me, I had to use screws

20. Place the motherboard over the motherboard tray, place both against the divider panel, mark the screw holes
- make sure the IO is opposite the cable cutouts and on the edge

21. Use the motherboard standoffs to punch holes where the marks are
- the holes shouldn't be any deeper than the screw part of the standoffs

22. Place your hard drives side by side with a small gap between, place the motherboard tray on top of your hard drives and align the cable cutouts with the plugs
- the front of the hard drives should be right at the edge of the 20mm cutout
- this is just to understand how the hard drives will line up

23. Put the hard drive screws upside down on top of the screw holes. Place the motherboard tray gently on top of the hard drives. Press straight down to puncture the cardboard with the screws.
- these holes will be on the opposite face of the motherboard screw holes
- this is the second hardest part of assembly, take your time

24. Punch the hard drive screw holes the rest of the way through the motherboard tray.
- they shouldn't be in the same place as the motherboard screw holes
- this can be done with a screwdriver if you're careful not to make it too wide, I used a thick sewing needle and widened the hole by circling it
- the screw will ultimately widen the hole enough

25. Screw the hard drives in
- this along with the fan mount is the hardest part of assembly, you will need long screws; I had to push mine in hard enough that they created a divot in the cardboard

26. Use hot glue to place the motherboard standoffs in the holes
- the holes alone are too flimsy to be used for the motherboard standoffs
- make sure the standoffs are all straight and the same height

27. Place and screw in the motherboard
- ideally you already have the CPU, cooler, and RAM installed

28. You can do this whenever, but now is a good time to plug in SATA data and power cables, and route the rest
- use the cable cutouts on the divider panel, I put ATX, CPU, and GPU cables through the top, and the rest through the bottom

29. Mark, measure, and punch the screw holes for your SSDs
- unfortunately I was only able to mount one with 2 screws opposite the power connector, the distance between SATA power connectors is very limiting, the other SSD hangs between the PSU and front panel
- the power connector also pushes against the case unless it's the last one, that's why the motherboard tray has cutouts to make room

30. Install the GPU and glue the GPU panel in place

31. Glue the PSU panel in place

32. Glue the back panel in place

33. Fold down the GPU bracket

34. Measure and punch screw holes for the GPU bracket

35. Screw down the GPU


Don't forget to plug in all your power cables.
Unless you have your own power button, you'll have to start your computer by jumping the power pins.
